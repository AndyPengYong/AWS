"SET DW" principle

1. S - The S is for sort key. Query filters access sort key columns frequently.

   Choose up to three columns to be the sort key columns
   Order the sort keys in increasing degree of specificity, but balance this with the frequency of use
   
2. E - The E is for encoding.Encoding sets the compression algorithm used for each column in each table.

3. T - The I is for table maintenance. The Amazon Redshift query optimizer creates more efficient execution plans
when query statistics are up-to-date.  Use the ANALYZE command to gather statistics after loading ,updating or deleting data from tables. Similary you can minimize the number of blocks scanned with the VACUUM command. VACUUM 
improves performance by doing the following:
   Removing the rows that have been logically deleted from the block,resulting in fewer blocks to scan.
   Keeping the data in sort key order, which helps targt the specific blocks for scanning.
  
4. D - The D is for table distribution.
   Key - You desingate a column for distribution.
   Even - Amazon Redshift assigns the compute nodes with a round-robin pattern.
   All - Amazon Redshift puts a complete copy of the table in the database slice of each compute node.
   
5. W - The W is for Amazon Reshift Workload management . If you use WLM, you control the folow of SQL statements through the compute clusters and how much system memory to allocate.
