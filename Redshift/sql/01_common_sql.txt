--Amazon Redshift provides access to the following types of system tables:

1.STL Tables for Logging 
These system tables are generated from Amazon Redshift log files to provide a history of the system.
Logging tables have an STL prefix.

STL_LOAD_ERRORS gives the log of errors encountered while inserting the data into cluster.

2.STV Tables for Snapshot Data
These tables are virtual system tables that contain snapshots of the current system data. Snapshot
tables have an STV prefix.
STV_RECENTS to give the recently completed or currently running queries in the cluster.

3.System Views
System views contain a subset of data found in several of the STL and STV system tables. Systems
views have an SVV or SVL prefix.

4.System Catalog Tables
The system catalog tables store schema metadata, such as information about tables and columns.
System catalog tables have a PG prefix.

PG_TABLE_DEF to list all the table names and columns present in the database.
